BLU3, huh? you hear me? it came out of me g
I ain't gon' flex, it came out of me, I said I can't fuck this up, haha

Good to now be here
It was love at first sight and misery after two months
Always feeling fucked up either by love or no love
"I thought you was married to the single life" she said
I wasn't necessarily looking for happiness, just less pain
I should've said somethin'
You said the only thing wrong with money is you ain't have enough of it
You said you deserve better, and now so do I
Anyways, the best part of us was me
When you got with me, you were a genius
Now without me you have to live life as an idiot
I don't write songs, I write life, I told you that
And you were only fuckin' with my feelings because you didn't know your own
I do miss who I thought you were
And sometimes I'm miserable without you, so it's just like you're still here
Shit

I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart, yeah

[XXXTENTACION]
Uh, 'cause I-I, I like to talk about love, and it's always on my mind
U'm, I'm always, oh, I've really stopped looking for someone
'Cause, currently, where my mind is, it's just like
I don't wanna say I've giving up but I've seen every make me promises
And make me promises on promises and never really fulfill, like
I was always looking for a caretaker
Looking for someone that would protect me, take initiative for me
And just be the greatest person they could for me
And, and that may be selfish, I don't know
But, it, that's just me being honest
And every time I've let myself be lead on by someone
They either deceive me or just treat me really, really really bad
And I'm, I'm a very genuine person, and I'm far too emotional
And I care too much
And I've, I've definitely cared too much in situations
and been fucked over, been fucked over, been fucked over...

A lot of artists that make it are evil, hearts black as tar, yeah
Ok and this for every rapper that had a shot at sending me
Your efforts ain't getting you anywhere in this industry
Lyrically demonically dominate your flow, endlessly
My venomous rhymes wine and dine on you mentally
Motivate the motivations, said got too much chemistry
Fatality, like Liu Kang told me to finish him
Even a hawk couldn't take this much intensity
I'm the bullet in the barrel in the gun that shot Kennedy
Mind is racing 'bout hating, contemplation with Haitians
Jamaicans, sitting on five g pacing
Back and forth, waiting and dating
You get the picture, don't take this
Boy this life is real, you couldn't fake this
Throw it up, regurgitation
